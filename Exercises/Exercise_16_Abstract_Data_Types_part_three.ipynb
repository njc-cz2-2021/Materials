    "A linked list Abstract Data Type (ADT) has the following operations defined:\n",
    "- `Create()`  --  creates an empty linked list;\n",
    "- `Insert(item, p)`  -- inserts new `value`, `item`, into linked list so that it is at position p in the linked list. Assume that the linked list contains at least `(p - 1)` items before the insertion.\n",
    "- `Delete(p)`  --  deletes the item at position p in the linked list;\n",
    "- `Length()`  --  returns the number of items in the linked list;\n",
    "- `IsEmpty()`  --  returns true if linked list is empty;\n",
    "- `IsFull()` – returns true if linked list is full;\n",
    "\n",
    "The linked list is implemented by the use of a collection of nodes that have two parts:  the item data and a pointer to the next item in the list. In addition there is a `Start` pointer which points to the first item in the list. \n",

    "The unused nodes are linked and the first unused node is the position where the next new data item is to be stored. Node removed from the linked list should be returned to `NextFree` list. \n",

    "Many programming languages use a variety of brackets eg `()`, `{}` and `[]` in their program statement constructs. Brackets can be nested e.g. `(())` and `{[]}`.

Whenever we encounter a close bracket, we check if it is of the same type with the item at the top of the stack. Once we have a match, we pop the topmost bracket from the stack. Only when we managed to read the last bracket and find that the stack is empty, then we know that the brackets are properly nested, and the program construct is well-formed. \n",

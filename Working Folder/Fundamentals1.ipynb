Each repetition is also known as an iteration. The results of one iteration are used as the starting point for the next iteration.\n",

    "3. **Do-While** (or Repeat-Until) loops : Similar to while-do loops, except the expression is evaluated at the end. Hence, the block of code is executed at once, then only repeats when the specified condition or set of conditions is met. "

    "In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "`list`  is a Python data type that \n",
    "\n",
    "- stores data in order it was added to it,\n",
    "- is **mutable**, meaning the values can change.\n",

    "Lists are created by using square brackets `[]`. For example\n",
    "\n",

    ">mylist=['Mathematics','Computing','General Paper']\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `mylist[n-1]` to access the $n$th element in the list `mylist`. Note that index is 0-based\n",
    "- Sometimes, you want a running sublist of the list instead. `mylist[i:k]` will the list that contains the $i$th element of `mylist` to the $k$th element. This is called **slicing** and more generally, `mylist[i:k:step]` \n",
    "- `mylist.append(myelement)` will add the element `myelement`  into the list `mylist`.\n",
    "- to concatenate lists `mylist` and `myanotherlist` to a list, we use the `+` operator. So the combined list is `mylist + myanotherlist`. Alternatively, you can also use the `.extend()` method, i.e.,  `mylist.extend(myanotherlist)` to get the same result. Also, `*`\n",
    "- to locate the position of the element `myelement` in the list `mylist`, we can use `.index()` method for lists. i.e., `mylist.index(myelement)`\n",
    "- to remove the element `myelement`, which has the index `myindex`, from the list `mylist`, we use `.pop()` method. The syntax is `mylist.pop(myindex)`\n",
    "- we can also use `for` loops to iterate over a list.\n",
    "- elements in the list can be arranged into numerical or alphabetical order via the `sorted()` function. We can also pass in the argument `reverse=True`  inside the function to get a descending order instead.\n",
    "- `.count()`, `.remove()`, `.insert()`"

    "\r\n",
    "All of us are familiar with the use of positive integers. In particular, we grew up learning how to count from a young age and (hopefully) none of us consider counting from 1 to 100 to be difficult. To count, we need to first understand the meanings of the symbols 0, 1, 2, . . ., 9 and also, the meaning of positions two identical in the integer. This way of writing out numbers is termed **positional notation / number system**. For example, when we write the number `107` to represent **one hundred and  seven**, we actually mean $$1\\times 10^2 +0\\times 10^1 +7\\times 10^0.$$ \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In particular, note that in our modern use of Hindu-Arabic numbers, we have 10 different symbols that we could mix and match to generate more numbers with by switching their positions in our writing. The number of such different symbols in a number system is called the **base** or **radix** of the number system. Thus, with this definition, our usual number system is base-10. This number system is also called **decimal** number system or **denary** system.\r\n",

    "However, from the diagram of symbols above, we see that they actually have more than 10 symbols in their system. In fact, Babylonian number system is more akin to our modern base-60 system.

Any group of 0s and 1s can be used to represent a specific character, for example, a letter. The number of bits used to store one character is called a **byte**. The complete set of characters that the computer uses is known as its **character set**. For example, the character `A` could be stored as `00000001`. The representation of characters as in terms of `0`s and `1`s are called **binary representation**.\r\n",

    "For example, a medical clinic needs to see the NRIC of a patient to identify the person. The clinic will need to keep the name, address, NRIC and contact number of the person with the medical notes for future reference. The PDPA allows for that. However, a shopping mall cannot collect the photographs of NRICs of all the shoppers that want to participate in their lucky draw. It is unnecessary to collect the photographs to verify the lucky draw participant. Instead, the participants can be identified with their mobile number, or be asked to give the last 4 characters of the NRIC (i.e. partial NRIC) for verification purposes. This reduces the security risks if the data collected is unintentionally revealed.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "NB: Note that PDPA does not apply to public agencies and organisations acting on behalf of them, thus, for example the police can collect your personal information, including NRIC/FIN. Data collected by public agencies are protected by other acts.

    "- Best case is when the array is already sorted and bubble sort will terminate after the first iterations. \n",
    "- Bubble sort is also efficient when one random element needs to be sorted into a sorted array, provided that new element is placed at the beginning and not at the end. \n",
    "- The absolute worst case for bubble sort is when the smallest element of the array is the last element in the end of the array. Because in each iteration only the largest unsorted element gets put in its proper location, when the smallest element is at the end, it will have to be swapped each time through the array, and it wont get to the front of the list until all $n$ iterations have occurred."

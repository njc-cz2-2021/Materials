    "Some Indian scholars have alleged that when Jūshīr daughter of Balhīt became queen, a rebel rebelled against her. Being an intelligent young woman, she sent one of her sons -she had four children- but the rebel killed her son.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distressed the people of her kingdom. Fearing to tell her the news, they gathered before one of their wise men -he was named Qaflān- a man of wisdom, cleverness, and good judgment—and they told him what had happened. He said, “Give me three days.” They did so, and he went apart to think. Then he said to one of his pupils, “Bring me a carpenter and wood of two different colors, white and black.” They brought a skilled carpenter and wood of two different colors, white and black. The wise man drew the figure of a chess board and commanded the carpenter, and he made it. Then he said to him, “Bring me a tanned hide.” He commanded him to draw sixty-four squares on it; he did so, and it was set aside. Then (the wise man and his pupil) played against each other until they understood the game and became proficient in it. Then he said to his pupil, “This is a war without loss of lives.” Then the people of the kingdom came to him, and he brought it out to them. When they saw it, they knew that it was a bit of wisdom that no one could arrive at. He began to play against his pupil, and the latter would suffer checkmate or defeat of his king.\n",
    "\n",
    "The queen was given a report about Qaflān, and she summoned him and commanded him to show her his wisdom. He produced his pupil with the chessboard and set it up between the pupil and himself. The two played, and one defeated the other [and said,] “Checkmate!” Taking notice and realizing what he meant, she said to Qaflān, “Has my son been killed?” “You have said it,” he said. She said to her chamberlain, “Let the people in, that they may offer me condolence.”...\n",
    "\n",
    "After this Jushir asked Qaflan about his payment, where he requested for wheat grains to be placed on the each of the squares on the chessboard. The first square will have 1 grain and in every successive every successive squares the amount of grains is double from the amount in the previous square. If Jushir does indeed grant Qaflan his payment, how much wheat will Qaflan receive?"

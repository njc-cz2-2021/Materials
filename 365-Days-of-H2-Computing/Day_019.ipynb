    "It is good programming practice to group statements into routines, such that each routine will do just one task. As routines are declared separately from the main program body.

    "## D19.1 Functions and Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "A routine may either correspond to a function or a procedure. A procedure corresponds to a sequence of steps that is given an identifier and can be called to perform a sub-task; procedures do not return any values to the code that called it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function corresponds to a sequence of steps that is given an identifier and returns a single value; a function call must be part of an expression (since it returns a value).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** In computer science, functions are a little different from functions we encounter in mathematics where functions are required to have a return value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### D19.1.1 Why use function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions help break program into smaller and modular chunks.\n",
    "* It supports code reusability and reduces repeative code.\n",
    "* It make large program more organized and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D19.1.2 Declaring and Calling a Function or Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define a procedure or function, we must first declare it. A routine declaration consists of a routine interface (i.e., routine header) followed by a routine body. The routine body is the statement block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example in pseudocode. \n",
    "\n",
    ">```coffeescript\n",
    ">1 FUNCTION square(n : INTEGER) : INTEGER\n",
    ">2    DECLARE result : INTEGER\n",
    ">3    result ← n * n\n",
    ">4    RETURN result\n",
    ">5 ENDFUNCTION\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above example, we notice that the routine interface (or more specifically, the function interface since the above example is corresponds to a function) includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The identifier or name of the function (i.e., `square`)\n",
    "- The parameter(s) (i.e., input variable(s)) for the function (i.e., the single input variable `n : INTEGER`)\n",
    "- The data type of the `result` to be returned (i.e., the last `INTEGER` on the first line)\n",
    "\n",
    "Correspondingly, the function body contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The various statements that define what the function does (i.e., each line after the function header/interface)\n",
    "- A statement that gives the function a value to return (i.e., the “return result” statement on the last line)\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, when we define a routine that requires values to be passed to the routine body, we use an ordered list of variables, termed **parameters**, in the routine interface. E.g., `n` is a parameter in the example above. \n",
    "When the routine is called with an actual input, the input is called an **argument**, i.e., the arguments supplied are assigned to the corresponding parameter of the routine. Do note the order of the parameters in the parameter list must be the same as the order in the list of arguments. Using our example above, in the expression `square(2)`, `2` is the argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "When an executed program gets to the statement that includes a function call as part of the expression, the function is executed. The value returned from this function call is then used in the expression. Thus, with the above line of code, the result of the `square(2)` function call is assigned to the variable `result`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do remember that only functions have return values. Thus, when a procedure is called, it does not form part of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a routine does not include any parameters, we simply specify an empty set of parentheses `()` instead. The following is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```coffeescript\n",
    ">1 FUNCTION get_integer(): INTEGER\n",
    ">2    INPUT “Input an integer value:” value\n",
    ">3    RETURN value\n",
    ">4 ENDFUNCTION\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above function may be called using:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```coffeescript\n",
    ">int_input ← get_integer()\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in both the function interface and the call to the function, only `()` is specified.\n",

    "When a program starts, a portion of the computer RAM is set aside to store variables and to keep track of the function calls in the program. This portion of the RAM is called **run time stack** or just **stack** for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The run time stack includes two kinds of things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **call frames** (also **activation records**), an area of memory that is set aside to keep track of a function call in progress. Each function call creates a call frame and when the function returns, the call frame is removed from the memory. Each call frame contains the name of the function that was called, and \"where to pick up from\" when the function call returns.\n",
    "2. storage for local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As functions are called, more call frames are put on the stack. The call frame on top of the stack is always the currently running function. When that function returns, it's call frame is popped off the stack. \n",

    "Recursion is very powerful, and often results in a very elegant solution to a problem. However, as explained previously, each time a routine is called, it invokes a new stack. Thus, because of the stack overheads, recursive algorithms may not be as efficient as iterative solutions. In contrast, an iterative solution typically only utilises a single stack. Additionally, if many recursive calls are made, stack space could run out. This is known as a stack overflow."

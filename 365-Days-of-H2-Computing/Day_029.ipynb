    "**Data Verification** is a process in which different types of data are checked for accuracy and inconsistencies after data migration is done. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Validation differs from **data verification**, which is the process of ensuring transferred data matches source data.  It typically involves automated or manual inspection (by human) and is performed after data is inputted to the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of data verification techniques.\n",

    "## 6.5.1 During Data Entry\n",
    "- *Visual Check*. The simplest form of data verification. The copied data is compared with the original data by manually inspecting them via sight. \n",
    "- *Double Entry*. For double entry, the user keys in the data value, which is followed by the software blanking out the first entry and ask the user to key in a second time. The two entries are then checked if they match. An example of double entry verification takes place during a typical account registration process, whereby the inputs of email and password are typically asked twice to ensure accuracy.\n",

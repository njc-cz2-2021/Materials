It is used to uniquely identify a record or row in a table. In the table description, the primary key is denoted with an underline on the attribute, e.g. $$\\text{Student}\\left(\\underline{\\text{MatricNo}},\\text{ Name, Gender, CivicsClass}\\right)$$\r\n",
    "- A **secondary key** is a candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key, i.e. an alternative to the primary key. A user often wants to search the database using the secondary key. However, it is up to the designer of the database which of the attributes will form the secondary key. The setting up of these secondary keys is called *indexing*. \r\n",

    "# 13.8.3 SQL Injection Protection with `sqlite3`\r\n",
    "SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its SQL database.  It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Consider a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL:\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    "This causes the application to make an SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Note that we can presume that: \r\n",
    "- This SQL query asks the database to return all details (`*`) from the `products` table where the category is `\"Gifts\"` and `released` is `1`.\r\n",
    "- The restriction `released = 1` is being used to hide products that are not released. For unreleased products, presumably `released = 0`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection attacks, so an attacker can construct an attack like:\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This results in the SQL query:\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The key thing here is that the double-dash sequence `--` is a comment indicator in SQL, and means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment. This effectively removes the remainder of the query, so it no longer includes `AND released = 1`. This means that all products has potential to be displayed, including unreleased products where `released = 0`.\r\n",

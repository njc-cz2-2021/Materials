However, it is up to the designer of the database which of the attributes will form the secondary key. The setting up of these secondary keys is called *indexing*. \r\n",

    "**Structured Query Language** (SQL) is a standard computer language for the operation and management of relational databases. It is a language used to query, insert, update and modify data.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "Each value stored in an SQLite database (or manipulated by the database engine) has one of the following storage classes:\r\n",
    "- `NULL`: The value is a NULL value.\r\n",
    "- `INTEGER`: used for a signed integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.\r\n",
    "- `REAL`: used for a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.\r\n",
    "- `TEXT`: used for a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).\r\n",
    "- `BLOB`: used for large binary data, such as images or multimedia in a database.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For the most part, \"storage class\" is indistinguishable from \"datatype\" and the two terms can be used interchangeably.\r\n",

These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a column or table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database. Constraints could be at a column level or table level. Column level constraints are applied only to one column, whereas table level constraints are applied to the whole table.\r\n",

    "- `AI` : Stands for **AUTOINCREMENT**. Automatically increments the value of the attribute for each new record. Works for integer values only.\r\n",
    "- `FOREIGN KEY` : Sets a **FOREIGN KEY** constraint where a column of a table can reference a column from another table or within the same table.\r\n",

    "# 13.8.3 SQL Injection Protection with `sqlite3`\r\n",
    "SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its SQL database.  It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Consider a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL:\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    "This causes the application to make an SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Note that we can presume that: \r\n",
    "- This SQL query asks the database to return all details (`*`) from the `products` table where the category is `\"Gifts\"` and `released` is `1`.\r\n",
    "- The restriction `released = 1` is being used to hide products that are not released. For unreleased products, presumably `released = 0`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection attacks, so an attacker can construct an attack like:\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This results in the SQL query:\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1\r\n",
    ">\r\n",
    ">```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The key thing here is that the double-dash sequence `--` is a comment indicator in SQL, and means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment. This effectively removes the remainder of the query, so it no longer includes `AND released = 1`. This means that all products has potential to be displayed, including unreleased products where `released = 0`.\r\n",

I saw my math teacher with a piece of graph paper yesterday. I think he must be plotting    something.
I had   an argument with a 90° angle. It turns out it was right.
A statistician got  soaking wet trying to cross a river. He thought he could cross, because it was one-foot deep on average.
Why is statistics never anyone’s favorite   subject? It’s just average.

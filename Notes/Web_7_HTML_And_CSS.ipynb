    "## 7.0.1 TCP/IP \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two procedures used for communication in the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Internet Protocol (IP) has the task of delivering units of data called **packets** from the source computer to the destination computer which are connected via the internet. To be able to do so, IP addresses, a numerical label, are assigned to each device connected to a computer network. An IP address serves two principal functions: \n",
    "    - it identifies the host, and \n",
    "    - it provides the location of the host in the network, and thus the capability of establishing a path to that host.  \n",
    "2. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides a communication service at an intermediate level between an application program and the Internet Protocol. TCP is responsible for routing application protocols to the correct application on the destination computer. To accomplish this, port numbers are used. Ports can be thought of as seperate channels on each computer. For example, you can surf the web while reading e-mail in the middle of a Zoom call with Genshin Impact open in a window. This is because these these applications used different port numbers. When a packet arrives at a computer and makes its way up the protocol stack, the TCP layer decides which application receives the packet based on a port number. E.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses 443, Genshin Impact is 42472.\n",

The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a **web browser**, and are published by a software application called a **web server**. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet.\n",

    "\n",
    "Domain names are human-readable addresses of an internet-connected computer. Whilst any internet-connected computer can be reached through a public IP address, IP addresses doesn't give a clear information about who's running the server or what service the website offers to a human user. Furthermore, IP addresses are hard to remember and might change over time.\n",

    "\n",
    "HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a **markup language** that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. HTML consists of a series of **elements**, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.\n",

    "- The content: This is the content of the element. \n",
    "- The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash `/` before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results. Note that some elements only consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document\n",

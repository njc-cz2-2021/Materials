However, it is up to the designer of the database which of the attributes will form the secondary key. The setting up of these secondary keys is called *indexing*. \n",

Constraints could be at a column level or table level. Column level constraints are applied only to one column, whereas table level constraints are applied to the whole table.\n",

In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.\n",

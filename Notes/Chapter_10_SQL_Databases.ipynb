    "- Rows are unique, i.e no repeated rows\n",

    "- A **primary key** is a candidate key that is most appropriate to become the main key for a table. It uniquely identifies each record in a table. It is a special case of the candidate key. It is used to uniquely identify a record or row in a table. In the table description, the primary key is denoted with an underline on the attribute, e.g. $$\\text{Student}\\left(\\underline{\\text{MatricNo}},\\text{ Name, Gender, CivicsClass}\\right)$$\n",
    "- A **secondary key** is a candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key, i.e. an alternative to the primary key. A user often wants to search the database using the secondary key. However, it is up to the designer of the database which of the attributes will form the secondary key. The setting up of these secondary keys is called *indexing*. \n",
    "- A **composite key** is a combination of two or more fields in a table that can be used to uniquely identify each record in a table. Uniqueness is only guaranteed when the fields are combined.\n",
    "- A **foreign key** is an attribute (field) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, i.e. it links to a primary key in a second table and form relationships between the tables.

If, for example, we want to know which employees have children born before 2005, the DBMS will need to perform data manipulation to extract the individual dates themselves.

    "Let $x,y$ be attributes in a table. We say that attribute $y$ is **functionally dependent** on attribute $x$ (usually the primary key), if for every valid instance of $x$, the value of $x$ **uniquely determines** the value of $y$ ($x \\rightarrow y$). \n",

    "In the `ORDER(1NF)` table, each order number is associated wtih one customer name and one city and each city is associated with one country.

    "[DB Browser for SQLite(DB4S)](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) is a simple and easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI) - based software for the creation and editing of database files compatible with SQLite. It abstracts and hides the details of complex SQL commands while providing an easy to user interface for performing the same database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DB4S, when we create tables, we can set **constraints**. Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns or table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a column or table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database. Constraints could be at a column level or table level. Column level constraints are applied only to one column, whereas table level constraints are applied to the whole table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common constraints we will see is:\n",
    "- `NN` : Stands for **NOT NULL**. Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.\n",
    "- `PK` : Sets a **PRIMARY KEY** constraint such that it uniquely identifies each row/record in a table.\n",
    "- `AI` : Stands for **AUTOINCREMENT**. Automatically increments the value of the attribute for each new record. Works for integer values only.\n",
    "- `FOREIGN KEY` : Sets a **FOREIGN KEY** constraint where a column of a table can reference a column from another table or within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate how we can do the CRUD operations in DB4S. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 16\n",
    "\n",
    "A library contains books that can be on loan to borrowers where:\n",
    "- A borrower can take one or many loans.\n",
    "- Each loan record belongs to only one borrower.\n",
    "- A book can be loaned many times.\n",

    "# 13.8.3 SQL Injection Protection with `sqlite3`\n",
    "SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its SQL database.  It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL:\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```\n",
    "This causes the application to make an SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can presume that: \n",
    "- This SQL query asks the database to return all details (`*`) from the `products` table where the category is `\"Gifts\"` and `released` is `1`.\n",
    "- The restriction `released = 1` is being used to hide products that are not released. For unreleased products, presumably `released = 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection attacks, so an attacker can construct an attack like:\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">\n",
    ">https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```\n",

    ">\n",
    ">SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1\n",
    ">\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing here is that the double-dash sequence `--` is a comment indicator in SQL, and means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment. This effectively removes the remainder of the query, so it no longer includes `AND released = 1`. This means that all products has potential to be displayed, including unreleased products where `released = 0`.\n",

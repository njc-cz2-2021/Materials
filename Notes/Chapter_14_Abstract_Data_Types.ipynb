    "# 14.0 Abstract Data Type and Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract data type** (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types. An abstract data type is defined by its behavior from the point of view of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.  This is analogous to an algebraic structure in mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, integers are an ADT, defined as the values ..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ..., and by the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, together with greater than, less than, etc., which behave according to familiar mathematics (with care for integer division), independently of how the integers are represented by the computer. Explicitly, \"behavior\" includes obeying various axioms (associativity and commutativity of addition, etc.), and preconditions on operations (cannot divide by zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **data structure** is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically integers are represented in a data structure as binary numbers, most often as two's complement, but might be binary-coded decimal or in ones' complement, but the user is abstracted from the concrete choice of representation, and can simply use the data as data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, **Abstract Data Type** (ADT): \n",
    "- specifies interactions/operations of the objects of the data type. \n",
    "- has no code. It is not the actual implementation.\n",
    "- often has more than one way to be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "While **Data Structure** (DS) is the actual representation of the data and the algorithms to manipulate the data elements. i.e concrete implementation of a ADT. Also, one allowable operation in ADT is one function implemented in the associated DS.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the **main advantage of ADT** is that users only need to understand the allowable operations of an ADT before using it. No knowledge of actual implementation is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.0.1 Static vs Dynamic Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static data structures** do not change in size while the program is running. A typical static data structure is an array. Once you declare its size (or upper bound), it cannot be changed. Some programming languages do allow the size of arrays to be changed (like Python's `list`), in which case they are dynamic data structures. For the purposes of A-Level syllabus, <u>an array is considered a static data structure</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic data structures** can increase and decrease in size while a program is running. A typical dynamic data structure is a linked list, which we will see later in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Disadvantages of Static Data Structures\n",
    "- Advantages\n",
    "    - Space allocated during compilation\n",
    "    - Easier to program\n",
    "    - Easy to check for overflow\n",
    "    - Random access, enables you to read or writeinformation anywhere in the file\n",
    "- Disadvantages\n",
    "    - Space allocation is fixed\n",
    "    - Wastes space when only partially used\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Advantages and Disadvantages of Dynamic Data Structures\n",
    "- Advantages\n",
    "    - Only uses space required\n",
    "    - Efficient use of memory\n",
    "    - Emptied storage can be returned to the system\n",
    "- Disadvantages\n",
    "    - Difficult to program\n",
    "    - Searches can be slow\n",
    "    - Serial access, i.e. you can only read and write information sequentially, starting from the beginning of the file."

Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a bucket with a matching key or an empty bucket.\n",

    "- Converting a string of usual mathematical expressions into its Reverse Polish Notation, a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. E.g., `(3+5)/3` is `3 5 + 3 /`. An advantage of reverse Polish notation is that it removes the need for parentheses that are required by infix notation. Similarly, ` 3 4 5 × −` in Reverse Polish means `3-(4×5)` in our usual infix mathematical notation."

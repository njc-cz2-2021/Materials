    "\n",
    ">A **program** is the actual expression of an algorithm in a specific programming language. It allows the computer to execute the problem solution through a sequence of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, an algorithm is generally produced in the design phase of a problem solution, while a program that expresses the algorithm is produced in the programming stage. A program is also made up of lines of code that can be categorized into either an **expression** or a **statement**. \n",
    "\n",
    ">An **expression** is a syntactic entity in a programming language that may be evaluated to determine its value.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A **statement**, on the other hand, is a syntactic entity, which has no value (merely an instruction.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">answers = 1+1:                # '1+1' is an expression\n",
    ">if answers == 2:\n",
    ">\tprint('Good Outlook')       # print('Good Outlook') is a statement.\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically 3 basic statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input statements\n",
    "2. Output statements\n",
    "3. Assignment statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, input and output (I/O) allows the communication between an information processing system (such as a computer) and an external entity (such as a human).\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is information supplied to a computer or program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output is information provided by a computer or program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment statements will be elaborated further in the later section.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">x = input(\"Enter a positive integer value for x: \") #example of input statement. Note that the user input is assigned to the variable x\n",
    ">print(x) #print statement to display the output\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic statement, and typically the first code you write when learning a programming language, is the output statement, which outputs certain data - e.g., printing `“hello world”`. There is typically also an input statement that will request input from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2.1 `print()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print(YOUR_SPECIFIED_MESSAGE)` function prints `YOUR_SPECIFIED_MESSAGE` to the screen, or other standard output device.\n",

Standard elements of a program include the ability to print out results (using the `print()` function), the ability to read input from a user at the console (e.g., using the `input()` function), and the ability to store values in a variable, so that the program can access that value as needed.\n",

    "With both typical and computational problem solving, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the problem\n",
    "2. Structure the problem - i.e., analyse and understand the problem\n",
    "3. Look for possible solutions\n",
    "4. Make a decision\n",
    "5. Implement the solution\n",
    "6. Monitor and/or seek feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Do note that each step should be revisited as greater insights into the problem are gleaned.\n",

    "## 0.2 Programs and Programming Languages\n",
    "\n",
    ">A **program** is the actual expression of an algorithm in a specific programming language. It allows the computer to execute the problem solution through a sequence of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, an algorithm is generally produced in the design phase of a problem solution, while a program that expresses the algorithm is produced in the programming stage. A program is also made up of lines of code that can be categorized into either an **expression** or a **statement**. \n",
    "\n",
    ">An **expression** is a syntactic entity in a programming language that may be evaluated to determine its value.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A **statement**, on the other hand, is a syntactic entity, which has no value (merely an instruction.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">answers = 1+1                # '1+1' is an expression\n",
    ">if answers == 2:\n",
    ">   print('Good Outlook')       # print('Good Outlook') is a statement.\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically 3 basic statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input statements\n",
    "2. Output statements\n",
    "3. Assignment statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, input and output (I/O) allows the communication between an information processing system (such as a computer) and an external entity (such as a human).\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is information supplied to a computer or program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output is information provided by a computer or program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment statements will be elaborated further in the later section.\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">x = input(\"Enter a positive integer value for x: \") #example of input statement. Note that the user input is assigned to the variable x\n",
    ">print(x) #print statement to display the output\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic statement, and typically the first code you write when learning a programming language, is the output statement, which outputs certain data - e.g., printing `“hello world”`. There is typically also an input statement that will request input from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2.1 Output Statements with `print()` \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, to get an output, we use the `print()` command. To use it, you put the content you want to output between the parentheses `()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`print('YOUR_SPECIFIED_MESSAGE')` function prints `YOUR_SPECIFIED_MESSAGE` to the screen, or other standard output device.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2.2 Input Statements with `input()` \n",
    "\n",
    "The `input(MSG_TO_USER)` command allows user input, where `MSG_TO_USER` is the text you want to display to user when you asked for the input. The text is an `str` object. `str` object can pretty much be thought of as text data and in Python, is indicated by a sequence of characters enclosed by single quotes, `'example'` or double quotes `\"another_example\"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using `input()`, variable assigned is also of `str` type. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2.3 Formatting output with `.format()` method or `f-string`\n",
    "f-strings are string literals that have an `f` at the beginning of the string and curly braces containing expressions that will be replaced with their values. "

Standard elements of a program include the ability to print out results (using the `print()` function), the ability to read input from a user at the console (e.g., using the `input()` function), and the ability to store values in a variable, so that the program can access that value as needed.\n",
